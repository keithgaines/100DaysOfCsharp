# Band Name Generator

This is a simple console application that generates a band name based on the user's input. It prompts the user to enter the name of the city they grew up in and the name of their pet, then suggests a band name by concatenating these two inputs.

## Getting Started

To run this application, you need to have the .NET runtime installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

Once you have .NET installed, you can run the application by opening a command prompt or terminal window, navigating to the directory where the code is saved, and entering the following command:

``` 

dotnet run 

```

This will compile and run the code, and you should see the program prompt you to enter the name of the city you grew up in and the name of your pet.

## Usage

1. Run the program by typing `dotnet run` in the command prompt or terminal window.
2. When prompted, enter the name of the city you grew up in and the name of your pet.
3. The program will generate a band name by concatenating the two inputs, and display it on the console.
4. Press any key to exit the program.
