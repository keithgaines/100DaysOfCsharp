Sure! Here's an example README file for your Hangman game project:

# Hangman Game

This is a console-based Hangman game written in C#.

## How to Play

1. Run the program in a console window.
2. The game will randomly select a word from a dictionary of common hangman words.
3. You will be given a number of guesses to try and guess the word.
4. Enter a letter to guess whether it's in the word or not.
5. If the letter is in the word, it will be displayed in the appropriate blanks.
6. If the letter is not in the word, your number of guesses remaining will decrease.
7. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word or run out of guesses.
8. If you guess the word before running out of guesses, you win! Otherwise, you lose.
