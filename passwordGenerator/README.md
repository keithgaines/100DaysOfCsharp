## Introduction

In today's digital age, secure passwords are more important than ever. However, creating strong passwords that are difficult to guess and easy to remember can be a challenge. This is where password generators come in handy. The Password Generator project is a simple C# program designed to help users generate strong and secure passwords.

## How it Works

The Password Generator prompts the user to input the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers for the password. Once the user provides this input, the program generates a password of random characters based on these inputs. The generated password is a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

## Features

The Password Generator offers the following features:

- Simple and easy to use interface
- Generates passwords of random characters
- Allows users to customize the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in the password
- Includes a list of common symbols to choose from

## Installation

To use the Password Generator, you need to have the .NET runtime installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official website: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download.

Once you have the .NET runtime installed, you can download the source code for the Password Generator from the GitHub repository. To run the program, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:
