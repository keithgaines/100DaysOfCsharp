# Calculator

The Calculator project is a simple command-line calculator built using C#. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers and then perform additional operations on the result with a new number.

## Getting Started

To run the Calculator program, you'll need to have the .NET Core SDK installed on your computer. You can download it from the [.NET Core download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

Once you have the .NET Core SDK installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator.git
```

Then navigate to the `Calculator` directory and run the program:

```
cd calculator
dotnet run
```

## Usage

When you run the Calculator program, you'll be prompted to enter two numbers and an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, or /). The program will then perform the operation and display the result.

After the initial calculation, the program will enter a loop that allows you to perform additional operations on the result with a new number. To do this, you'll need to enter an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, or /) and a new number. The program will then perform the operation and display the updated result.

To exit the program at any time, type 'q' when prompted to enter an arithmetic operation.
