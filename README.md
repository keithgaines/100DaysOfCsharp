# Welcome to '100 Days Of CSharp'!

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my progress and learning journey in C# programming language over a period of 100 days. As someone who has successfully completed the 100-day Python challenge, I'm excited to further expand my skills by delving into C# for my backend needs.

## What's Inside

This repository is a comprehensive collection of my progress, including code snippets, projects, and resources related to C# programming. Each day's directory contains the C# code I wrote, along with detailed notes and resources that I found valuable. Additionally, I have included a README file in each directory summarizing that directory.
